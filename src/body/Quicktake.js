          On an OAS basis, DF 2023s are trading at 372bp, compared with the
          Barclays US HY Index at 434bp, Ba index at 301bp, and US Food &amp;
          Beverage index at 316bp. We think there could be 30-50bp of absolute
          return upside, as well as excess spread performance, due to the
          current discount to the relevant benchmarks.
